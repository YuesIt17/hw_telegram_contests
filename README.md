## What's missing?

There are features missing from this showcase product which should exist in a real product:

### Proper authentication system 🔐

We currently store the username in local storage and run the project without valid credentials. In a real product, we would like to implement a proper email and password authentication system.

### Cypress tests 🧪

Need to implement UI testing in a project using Cypress.
